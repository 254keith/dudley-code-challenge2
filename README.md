## Description

This repository contains solutions to three JavaScript code challenges tackled over the weekend.

### Challenge 1: Uppercase and lowercase swapping
Write a function that accepts a string as input and swaps the case of each character. For example if you input 'The Quick Brown Fox' the output should be 'tHE qUICK bROWN fOX'.

### Challenge 2: Number generator(generates an array between numbers)
Write a JavaScript function that accepts two numbers to generate an array between them. For example, if the two numbers are 4 and 7, the output should be [4, 5, 6, 7] and -4 and 7 should return [-4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7].

### Challenge 3: Prime number generator
You are tasked with writing a function that takes an array of numbers as input and returns a new array containing only the prime numbers from the original array. How would you implement this function efficiently, ensuring that it accurately identifies prime numbers and returns them in the same order they appear in the input array? For example if you provide an array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10] it should return an array [2, 3, 5, 7].

##Use of readline module
I used nodemon to check on the output,by basically writing it on my terminal eg (nodemon solution1.js)(console).
